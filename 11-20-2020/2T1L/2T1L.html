                <h3>Built a cardboard kayak and raced it on the river.</h3>
                    <p>When I was in college several years ago I built a cardboard boat which i raced in a regatta, and I was fine until I took a turn too hard. The side of the boat dipped underweater and as soon as it dipped under the water it sank.</p>

                <h3>Been hit by a car twice while riding my bike and now I always wear a helmet (when I ride my bike, not like, normally lol).</h3>
                    <p>The first time I fractured 3 ribs, but at least I got out of school for a week. The second time was a taxi driver's fault downtown while I was riding for Jimmy Johns. </p>

                <h3>House is filled with 98 plants of varying types.</h3>
                    <p>I collect cacti, succulents, tropical trees, house plants, etc. I emptied out my closet, setup a wire rack and hung two fluourescent lights per level, 4 levels total, where I keep all my tropical plants over the winter. Am currently working on a raspberry pi project to monitor temperature and humidity inside the closet. </p>
